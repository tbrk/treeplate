Treeplate
=========

Treeplate is a set of XSLT scripts for generating static websites. Authors
write XHTML content by hand and provide a description of the site hierarchy.
Treeplate generates the site, automatically fitting the content into
boilerplate XHTML for
* headers, including stylesheet, icon, and
  [relation links](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/links.html#h-12.1.2),
* footers, including author and last changed date,
* a hierarchical menu bar without scripting, and
* a [sitemap](http://www.sitemaps.org) file for search engines.

These scripts are rather dated but I still find them useful for my
[personal website](http://www.tbrk.org). Using XSLT seemed like a good idea
at the time, but maintaining such code is a nightmare.
