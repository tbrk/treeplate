* Fix sitemap generation:
  - respect extension attribute
  - substitute in alternate urls if they are relative to the site.

* Add Table of Contents feature (single page first)
* Tooltip for footnote link.
* References (like multiple footnotes from different places to same item)
* Shortcut for author's email address.
* Special tag for viewport, not just in sitetree, but take the closest one
  in the hierarchy. i.e. allow override for subsites (like a wider viewport
  for websvn)
